# Privacy Policy for NPM Stats for GitHub Extension

**Effective Date:** 30 September 2017

Thank you for using NPM Stats for GitHub! Your privacy is important, and this policy explains what data is collected and how it is used.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

NPM Stats for GitHub does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The extension runs entirely in your browser and does not track user activity.

However, to provide package statistics, the extension makes network requests to external APIs, specifically:

- api.github.com – to retrieve repository-related information.
- registry.npmjs.org – to fetch package statistics from the npm registry.

These requests are made directly from your browser and are necessary to display the relevant package statistics on GitHub pages.

## 2. Permissions

The extension requires access to github.com to retrieve repository information and inject NPM package statistics directly into GitHub pages. This permission is strictly used to improve your experience and does not involve data collection beyond the necessary API requests.

## 3. Third-Party Services

This extension does not use third-party analytics, tracking services, or advertising networks. However, it interacts with third-party APIs (GitHub and npm) to fetch publicly available package information.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.

## 5. Contact

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue on the [GitHub Issues tab](https://github.com/katranci/github-npm-stats/issues).
